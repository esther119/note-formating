# How to Learn Better through Twitter

### Storytelling

* A good story links related things together
* Images complement text
* Text limits: like putting information on slides

### LinkedList

* Threads should link tightly together

### Mindset

* Treat Twitter as a environment for concise writing
* Inspired by Andrew Cote: make it a drill to format and explain what you're learning daily
* Even if you can't do in-depth learning every day, you can still learn to format and explain what you're learning
* Focus on learning, not engagement; be loyal to your learning goals
