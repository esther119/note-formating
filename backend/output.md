# ONNX
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open format built to represent machine learning models.

Interoperability: ONNX aims to provide interoperability between different machine learning frameworks. This means you can train a model in one framework (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) and then transfer it to another framework (like Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Apple CoreML) for deployment.

Interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or products to connect and communicate in a coordinated way.

# ONNX Runtime
ONNX Runtime is an open-source inference engine for executing ONNX models. It is designed to be high-performance and lightweight, making it well-suited for deployment on a wide range of hardware platforms, including edge devices, servers, and cloud services.

An ONNX file is actually an extensible specification consisting of three parts:

1. Definition of an extensible computational graph model
2. Standard data type definition
3. Definition of internal operators (built-in)
