**ONNX**
===============

**Interoperability**
-------------------

ONNX aims to provide interoperability between different machine learning frameworks. This means you can train a model in one framework (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) and then transfer it to another framework (like Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Apple CoreML) for deployment.

**Interoperability**
-------------------

Interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or products to connect and communicate in a coordinated way.

**ONNX Runtime**
----------------

ONNX Runtime is an open-source inference engine for executing ONNX models. It is designed to be high-performance and lightweight, making it well-suited for deployment on a wide range of hardware platforms, including edge devices, servers, and cloud services.

**An ONNX file is actually an extensible specification consisting of three parts:**

1. Definition of an extensible computational graph model
2. Standard data type definition
3. Definition of internal operators (built-in)
